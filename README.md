# RacingTeams' react-challange
*A simple React exercise to show us your skills!*

## Goal
Implement a web page copying the home page of the Airbnb site (https://www.airbnb.com).

The layout, style and functionalities of the page should be as close as possible to the original one.
## Instructions
The following functionalities should be implemented:

- create a local small rest api to serve the data from the data.json file

- fetch the data using axios and render it inside the cards as on the original Airbnb site.

- The card list should be filterable by “property_type” and sortable for price ASC/DESC.

## Assumptions:
- Use react with js/ts
- Use axios to fetch the data
- Use material ui lib https://mui.com/ with emotion or styled components. Use css only if strictly necessary.
- Use any tool / lib you need to
- Publish your code into a git repo

## Tips 
- The filtering section could be similar to the following

![filter airbnb](filter.png "filter airbnb")

You are free to choose the icons you like.
The property_type to filter can be hardcoded client side. Not more than one filter at time should be enabled.   

- The sorting section could be similar to the following

![sorting airbnb](sorting.png "sorting airbnb")


- When a card is clicked the related info should be printed in the console log.

- No other functionalities are required, but any further functionality implementation is a plus. 
Every assumption not specificaly stated is on you.

## Evaluation
The following arguments will be matter of evaluation and further discussion during the technical interview:
- Code cleanness
- Code structure and project organization
- Correct use of  modern javascript / typescript 
- Code readability
- Styling of resulting page
- Significant additional functionalities implemented
